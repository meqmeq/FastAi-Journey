Hello fellow AI enthousiast!

My name is Marc and I'm a recentundergraduate in Mechanical Engineering in Canada and I have a passion in learning AI. 

I come from a completely different background but I've always had interest in robotics and data. After completing 2 lessons of FastAI, I wanted to continue the course and brush up my coding and AI skills. 

Let's go on this journey together!
